            <p>BMI is a useful measurement for most people over 18 years old. But it is only an
                estimate and it doesn't take into account age, ethnicity, gender and body
                composition. We recommend you also check your waist measurement and other
                risk factors.</p>
            <p>Speak to your doctor, an Accredited Practising Dietitian or a health practitioner
about your weight.</p>
